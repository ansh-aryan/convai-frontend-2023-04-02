## Tech Stack

    * NextJs supports file based routing which makes routing between pages very fast and easy.
- TailwindCSS

- TypewriterJs
    * TypewriterJs is used to replicate ChatGPT's way of giving responses in order to make the user more inclinded to use this application because of the familiarity in user experience.



## Future Prospects

The following feautures can be added to the WebApp to make it more powerful and efficient :- 

- Adding a database (prefarably PostgreSQL)   
    * Keeping a record of all the chats the user has had with application can be helpful to reduce the load on the WebApp because it can be used to better understand a user's habits and can be used to emphasize more on the topics that are being frequently requested by the user.
    * Also keeping track of the questions our application is unable to answer is beneficial to us as it opens up room for improvement in the language models.

- Integration with chatbot applications like Dialogflow
